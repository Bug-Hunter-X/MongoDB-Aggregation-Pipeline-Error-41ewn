# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines that leads to inaccurate results. The original query attempts to find the top 10 most frequent values in a specific field but fails to produce the correct output due to an error in the pipeline's construction.  The solution provides a corrected pipeline that accurately delivers the desired results.

## Bug Description
The primary issue lies in the ordering and composition of the stages within the aggregation pipeline.  The original query resulted in an unexpected result set, failing to identify the true top 10 most frequent values.

## Solution
The solution corrects the aggregation pipeline by re-ordering and potentially adding stages to ensure the correct filtering, grouping, sorting, and limiting operations occur in the intended sequence. This modification guarantees that the returned results accurately reflect the top 10 most frequent values.
